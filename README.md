# Quick read for context 
Hello, and welcome to my version of Flappy Bird! Thank you for accessing this repo, but you might wonder, "What is so special about your flappy bird?" Well, I decided to adapt a famous Brazilian meme, the "Galo de Cal√ßa" or "Rooster/Chicken with pants," for my version of this game.<br>
<br>That's it. I incorporated a funny and unique way of learning something new in coding (mostly the library pygame) and avoided reproducing 100% of the code on YouTube.<br>
<br>Also, there is an original image of the meme (check references folder).
